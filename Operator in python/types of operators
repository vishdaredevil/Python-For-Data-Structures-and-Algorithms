Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They help in calculations, comparisons, logic building, and more.
Types of Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators
Perform basic mathematical operations:
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `//` (Floor Division)
- `%` (Modulus)
- `**` (Exponentiation)

2. Comparison Operators
Compare values and return Boolean results:
- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)

3. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements:
- `and` (Both conditions must be True)
- `or` (At least one condition must be True)
- `not` (Reverses the Boolean value)

4. Assignment Operators
Used to assign or update variable values:
- `=` (Assign)
- `+=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=` (Modify and assign)

5. Bitwise Operators
Operate at the binary level:
- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Left Shift)
- `>>` (Right Shift)

6. Membership Operators
Check membership in sequences:
- `in` (Exists in sequence)
- `not in` (Does not exist in sequence)

7. Identity Operators
Compare memory locations:
- `is` (Same memory location)
- `is not` (Different memory location)

Operator Precedence
Determines the order in which operations are evaluated:
1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponentiation `**`
3. Unary operators `+`, `-`, `~`
4. Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Floor Division `*, /, %, //`
5. Addition, Subtraction `+, -`
6. Bitwise Shift `<<, >>`
7. Bitwise AND `&`
8. Bitwise XOR `^`
9. Bitwise OR `|`
10. Comparison Operators `==, !=, <, <=, >, >=`
11. Logical NOT `not`
12. Logical AND `and`
13. Logical OR `or`
14. Assignment Operators `=, +=, -=, etc.`

IMPORTAND POINTS FOFR OPERATOR:
- Operators help manipulate data, simplify logic, and control program flow.
- Parentheses override precedence.
- Associativity determines order when operators have the same precedence.
- Use parentheses to improve readability and avoid ambiguity.
