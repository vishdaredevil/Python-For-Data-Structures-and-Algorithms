Competitive Programming – Fast and efficient problem-solving
Python’s vast ecosystem and adaptability make it a go-to language for developers worldwide! 




Python for Competitive Programming 
Python is a beginner-friendly and powerful language widely used in competitive programming. 
It offers simple syntax, built-in data structures, and extensive libraries, making problem-solving efficient and fast.

Key Advantages:
✅ Readable & concise code for quick implementations
✅ Built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets
✅ Extensive libraries (math, collections, heapq, itertools, etc.)
✅ Dynamic typing and high-level operations
✅ Fast prototyping and easy debugging

Performance Tips:
1. Use sys.stdin.read() for fast input handling
`sys.stdin.read()` is used to read large inputs quickly in Python, especially in competitive programming. 
It reads all input at once, making it faster than multiple `input()` calls.  
#### **Example:**  
```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])  
arr = list(map(int, data[1:]))  
print(sum(arr))
```

This method helps handle large datasets efficiently and improves execution speed.
2. Prefer list comprehensions for optimized loops
3. Leverage built-in functions like sum() and sorted()
4. Use heapq for priority queues instead of manual heaps

Python’s flexibility and efficiency make it an excellent choice for coding competitions and algorithmic problem-solving!
